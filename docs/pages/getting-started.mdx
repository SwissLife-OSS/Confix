# Getting Started

<Steps>

### Install the tool

The tool is published to [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Confix) and can be installed using
```bash
dotnet tool install Confix
```

Requirements: 
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 7.0 or later)

### Create a `.confixrc`

TODO: add docu what should be in there or have a confix init providing usable defaults

### Initialise Confix Solution

```bash
confix solution init
```

This should happen in the folder where you usually open your IDE since files required for Variable Intellisense will be created here.

### Initialise Confix Project

```bash
confix project init
```

This should happen next to your `.csproj` of your project

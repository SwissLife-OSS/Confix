# Reporting

When you're working with multiple services in Confix that use shared variables, it can be
challenging to determine the exact version of a variable that's deployed. For instance, if you're
rotating secrets and only creating configurations during the build phase, you'll want to identify
which deployed service still operates on the old secret. You might also want to know which service
uses a specific component and its version.

To assist with this, Confix provides a reporting feature. Execute the following command within your
Confix project, and it will generate a detailed report on all project information, variables, and
components:

```bash copy
confix project report â€”out-file report.json
```

Add this JSON report to your build pipeline. When releasing the service in your release pipeline,
send it to your logging system or a custom service for storage. This approach lets you easily track
which secret version is in use in different deployments.

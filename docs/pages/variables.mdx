# Variables

Confix has the concept of variables. These variables are typically used to reference secrets, or any
configuration data that should not be directly entered into the configuration files. They can be
used for values are not known at development time.

In Confix, variables have a distinct structure: `$providerName:path.to.resource`, where
`providerName` refers to the source or provider of the variable value, and `path.to.resource`
indicates the specific resource or secret in the provider's repository. Variables may be nested in
strings. in that case the variable must be placed within double curly braces like
`{{$provider:path.to.resource}}`.

Variables are resolved during the `build` operation of the configuration. This operation can take
place at various stages of your development lifecycle. You can also `validate` your configuration
against a specific environment to ensure that all variables can be resolved before deployment. For
more on this, checkout [Deployments ](./deployments).

During project initialization, all potential variables are fetched from the providers (if possible),
offering intelligent code completion during your development.

## Providers

Variable providers are typically defined in the `.confixrc` or `.confix.solution` files but can also
be defined in `.confix.project`.

The `variableProviders` property determines the variable providers that are available for your
project. These providers assist in resolving variables present in your configuration files.

Each variable provider is identified by a name, which is how it's referenced in your config files.
For instance, if you have a variable provider defined as `"name": "secret"`, it can be referenced in
your configuration files using `$secret`.

The `type` field defines the type of the provider. Each type carries its specific configuration. For
example, the `azure-keyvault` type would require configuration related to Azure Keyvault, while the
`secret` type would need details about public and private keys.

The `environmentOverride` property lets you override provider-specific configuration based on the
environment. This can be useful when, for instance, a provider has different URLs for different
environments like development, staging, or production.

**Sample**

```json
{
  "name": "local",
  "type": "local",
  "path": "./variables.json",
  "environmentOverride": {
    "dev": {
      "path": "./variables.dev.json"
    }
  }
}
```

This provider would use the `./variables.json` unless the environment is `dev`, in which case `./variables.dev.json` would be used.

### Sample Configuration

Here is an example JSON demonstrating the structure of the `variableProviders` property:

```json copy filename=".confixrc"
{
  "variableProviders": [
    {
      "name": "local",
      "type": "local",
      "path": "./variables.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "keyvault",
      "type": "azure-keyvault",
      "environmentOverride": {
        "dev": {
          "uri": "https://mykeyvault-dev.vault.azure.net"
        },
        "qa": {
          "uri": "https://mykeyvault-qa.vault.azure.net"
        },
        "prod": {
          "uri": "https://mykeyvault-prod.vault.azure.net"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Supported Providers

| Type           | Descriptions                                           | Docs                                |
| :------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| azure-keyvault | Variables stored in an Azure KeyVault                  | [Docs竊余(./variables/azure-keyvault) |
| git            | fetch variables stored in a separate git repository    | [Docs竊余(./variables/git)            |
| local          | reference local variables stored in a `json` file      | [Docs竊余(./variables/local)          |
| secret         | inline the secrets using public-private key encryption | [Docs竊余(./variables/secrets)        |

Additional can be easily implemented. Contributions are welcomed.

## Example JSON with Variables

Here's an example JSON configuration file that uses Confix variables:

```json
{
  "database": {
    "connectionString": "$keyvault:database.connectionString",
    "maxPoolSize": 12
  },
  "logging": {
    "level": "$git:logging.level",
    "destinatin": "$git:logging.server.url"
  },
  "appSecrets": {
    "apiKey": "$secret:aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g/dj1hM1o3ekVjN0FYUQ==",
    "jwtSecret": "$vault:jwt.secret"
  },
  "clients": {
    "baseUrl": "{{$keyvault:api.baseUrl}}/my-endpoint"
  }
}
```

## Commands

Confix provides the following commands to manage variables

- `confix variables list`: This command lists all available variables from the providers.
- `confix variables set`: This command sets the value for a specified variable.
- `confix variables get <name>`: This command retrieves the current value of a specified variable.

# File Structure

A Confix solution (`.confix.solution`) closely align with the "scope" of a Git repository. Meaning
that usually you have one solution per git repository. In a typical solution, you might find various
projects, modules, or packages. These can be backend services, workers, shared libraries, frontend
applications, etc., each with could have separate configuration.

Every project, module, or package that has configuration files, should contain a `.confix.project`
file at its root, which serves as the project's main configuration. The repository's root folder
should contain a `.confix.solution` file, providing an overarching configuration for the entire
repository.

Confix generates a configuration for Visual Studio Code or Rider in the `.vscode` folder at the solution
level. This means that when you need to configure your services config files, you have to open the
solution root in IDE. Otherwise you do not have the intellisense and validation (as the correct json
schema is not loaded).

For larger structures, such as mono-repos, you may define multiple `.confix.solution` files. In this
case, the repository should be opened in IDE from the folder containing the relevant
`.confix.solution` file.

To share the setup across solutions in a monorepo, you can create a `.confixrc` file at the root.
When doing so, remember to set `"isRoot": false` in the configuration, prompting Confix to continue
looking for the root `.confixrc` file.

## Setting Defaults

In `.confixrc` or `.confix.solution`, you can predefine defaults for your `.confix.project` files
using the `project` property. This feature promotes consistency and reduces redundancy by ensuring
standard configurations across different projects.

Similarly, if you wish to establish default configurations for all components, use the `component`
property.

## Files

Confix provides a set of configuration files that allow you to manage settings on global,
repository, project, and component. These files include: `.confixrc`,
`.confix.solution`, `.confix.project`, and `.confix.component` .

Each configuration file serves a unique purpose in the overall Confix configuration process:

### 1. `.confixrc`

This global configuration file is located in the reopository root or the user's home directory.
The `.confixrc` files are inherited by all subfolders and projects.

1. ~/.confixrc
2. ./.confixrc
3. ./subfolder/.confixrc

It is used to define global settings that are applied across all solutions and projects.
Settings defined here are inherited by the `.confix.solution`, `.confix.component`, and `.confix.project` files.

You can override project-specific settings by using the `project` field in the `.confixrc` file. In
case of multiple `.confixrc` files, settings can be overridden in the parent folder's `.confixrc`
files. To signal Confix to look for further `.confixrc` files in parent folders and the home
directory, you need to specify `isRoot: false`.

```json
{
  "isRoot": false,
  "project": {
    // default project config like in .confix.project,
  },
  "component": {
    // default component config like in .confix.component
  }
}
```

### 2. `.confix.solution`

This configuration file is defined at the root of the repository. It is used to specify
repository-specific settings applicable across all projects within the repository. Settings defined
here are inherited by the `.confix.component` and `.confix.project` files.

Project-specific settings can be overridden by using the `project` field in the `.confix.solution`
file.

```json
{
  "project": {
    // default project config like in .confix.project,
  },
  "component": {
    // default component config like in .confix.component
  }
}
```

### 3. `.confix.project`

This file is used to configure a specific project.

```json
{
  "name": "MyProject",
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": "dev"
    },
    {
      "name": "prod"
    }
  ],
  "components": {
    "@shared-components/Example": "latest"
  },
  "configurationFiles": [
    {
      "type": "appsettings",
      "useUserSecrets": true
    }
  ],
  "componentProviders": [
    {
      "name": "dotnet",
      "type": "dotnet-package"
    }
  ],
  "variableProviders": [
    {
      "name": "local",
      "type": "local",
      "path": "$project:/variables.A.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. `.confix.component`

The `.confix.component` file is used for configuring individual components.
More about this can be found in the [Components](/components) section.

```json
{
  "name": "MyComponent",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "graphql"
    }
  ]
}
```

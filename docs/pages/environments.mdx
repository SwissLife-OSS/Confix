# Environments

It is common practice to deploy applications across various environments such as development,
staging, or production. Each environment may require a unique set of configurations and variable
providers. To accommodate this, Confix enables you to define the environments where your application
will be deployed.

The `environments` field allows you to define the various environments for your application in
`.confixrc`, `.confix.solution`, or `.confix.project` files. These environments are inherited in the
order: `.confixrc` -> `.confix.solution` -> `.confix.project`. Hence, settings defined in
`.confixrc` can be overridden in `.confix.solution`, and in turn, these can be overridden in
`.confix.project`.

In certain scenarios, you might want to selectively enable or disable environments at a subfolder
level. For example, if you wish to disable the 'staging' environment in a specific subfolder, you
can do so by simply listing the active environments like `["dev", "prod"]` in the `environments`
field for that specific configuration level. This will exclude 'staging' from the active
environments for the respective configuration scope.

Here are the properties that can be configured for each environment object:

- `name`: This property sets the name of the environment, serving as a unique identifier.

- `enabled`: This property indicates whether the environment is active or not.

With these advanced configuration options, Confix provides you with a high level of control,
allowing you to customize how each environment handles configuration files and variables.

Here's an example of how you could define these settings in a `.confix.project` JSON file:

```json filename=".confixrc" copyonfixrc" copy
{
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": "development"
    },
    {
      "name": "production"
    }
  ]
}
```

If a project only needs to be deployed to a single environment, you can specify the environment
directly in the `.confix.project` file:

```json filename=".confix.project" copy
{
  "environments": ["development"]
}
```

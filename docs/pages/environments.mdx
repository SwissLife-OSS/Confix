# Environments

It is common practice to deploy applications across various environments such as development, staging, or production. Each environment may require a unique set of configurations and variable providers. To accommodate this, Confix enables you to define the environments where your application will be deployed.

The `environments` field allows you to define the various environments for your application in `.confixrc`, `.confix.solution`, or `.confix.project` files. These environments are inherited in the order: `.confixrc` -> `.confix.solution` -> `.confix.project`. Hence, settings defined in `.confixrc` can be overridden in `.confix.solution`, and in turn, these can be overridden in `.confix.project`.

In certain scenarios, you might want to selectively enable or disable environments at a subfolder level. For example, if you wish to disable the 'staging' environment in a specific subfolder, you can do so by simply listing the active environments like `["dev", "prod"]` in the `environments` field for that specific configuration level. This will exclude 'staging' from the active environments for the respective configuration scope.

Here are the properties that can be configured for each environment object:

- `name`: This property sets the name of the environment, serving as a unique identifier.

- `excludeFiles`: This property lists the configuration files that should be excluded from this particular environment. This can be useful when certain variables are only applicable to specific environments. For example, if a variable is present in 'staging' but not in 'production', you could use this property to exclude the configuration file containing that variable when in the 'production' environment. This prevents validation issues due to non-existent variables in the configuration.

- `includeFiles`: In contrast to `excludeFiles`, this property identifies the configuration files that should be included in the environment. Any configuration files not listed here are excluded from the environment.

- `enabled`: This property indicates whether the environment is active or not. 

With these advanced configuration options, Confix provides you with a high level of control, allowing you to customize how each environment handles configuration files and variables.

Here's an example of how you could define these settings in a `.confix.project` JSON file:

```json
{
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": "development",
      "excludeFiles": ["appsettings.staging.json"]
    },
    "staging",
    {
      "name": "production",
      "excludeFiles": ["appsettings.staging.json"]
    }
  ]
}
```

# Initial Setup

Confix can be installed in two different ways: globally on your machine, or bound to a specific project. Below are the instructions for both methods of installation.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 7.0 or later) installed on your machine.

## Global Installation

To install Confix globally on your machine, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global Confix
```

This will make Confix available globally on your machine, allowing you to use it in any project.

## Project-Specific Installation

If you prefer to bind Confix to a specific project, you'll need to leverage the tool manifest provided by .NET Core. Here’s how you do it:

1. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
2. Run the following command to create a tool manifest file if you don’t have one already:

```bash
dotnet new tool-manifest
```

3. Now, install Confix in your project using the following command:

```bash
dotnet tool install Confix
```

By following the above steps, Confix will be installed in your project, and its scope will be limited to the current project directory.

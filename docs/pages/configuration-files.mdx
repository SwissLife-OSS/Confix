# Configuration Files

Confix allows you to specify the configuration files used by your project setup using the
`configurationFiles` property. Essentially, it lets you identify which JSON files in your project
should be validated against the compiled schema.

One key feature of Confix is its capability to automatically modify the `settings.json` of Visual
Studio Code (or Rider) in the repository root, mapping a JSON schema to the specified files. For instance, in
ASP.NET core projects, these configuration files would typically be the `appsettings.json` files.

At the moment the configuration file is optimized for `appsettings.json` from .NET Core,
but it can easily be extended to other configuration files.

Let us now when you want to use it in e.g. Node.js or Java projects, so we now the requirements.

Below is an example of defining these settings in a `.confixrc` JSON file:

```json filename=".confixrc" copy
{
  "project": {
    "configurationFiles": [
      {
        "type": "appsettings",
        "useUserSecrets": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

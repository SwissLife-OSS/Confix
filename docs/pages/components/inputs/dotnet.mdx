# Dotnet

The `dotnet` input is a special input that you require to add then you want to distribute your
components in a package.

This provider ensures that the embedded resources are added to the package.

## Configuration

```json copy filename=".confixrc"
{
  "component": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "dotnet"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Example

When we add this input to a project that contains a `.csproj`, the following will be added to the
project file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)/Components/**/*.*" />
</ItemGroup>
```

# Providers

In Confix, it's essential to specify where the system should search for component references.
This is done by defining **component providers**.
These providers can point to various sources, such as component registries or .NET packages, to locate the related components.

# Getting Started

In this example we will configure the `git` provider and fetch components from a git repository.

<Callout type="info">
  If you use the `dotnet-package` provider, you will not need to reference
  components in the project file. This is all done over the package references!
</Callout>

Make sure you do have a repository that has defines a `.confixrc` a `.confix.solution` and a `.confix.project` file.
For example like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="/" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name=".confixrc" active />
    <FileTree.File name=".confix.solution" active />
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="Website" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name=".confix.project" active />
        <FileTree.File name="appsettings.json" />
        <FileTree.File name="Program.cs" />
        <FileTree.File name="Website.csproj" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

To use a provider, you need to define them in the `project.componentProviders` section in your `.confixrc` file.
We

```json
{
  "project": {
    "componentProviders": [
      {
        "name": "shared", // <-- this is the name of the provider that we will use later
        "type": "git",
        "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/SwissLife-OSS/Confix.git",
        "path": "examples/ComponentRegistry"
      }
    ],
    "configurationFiles": [
      {
        "type": "appsettings",
        "useUserSecrets": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can checkout the component registry here: https://github.com/SwissLife-OSS/Confix.git

We can now add components to our project from the registry by calling

```bash
confix component add @shared/Example
```

```ascii
✓ Running in scope Project
✓ Configuration loaded
✓ Component inputs loaded
✓ Component '@shared/Example' was added
```

By executing this command the component provider `git` is invoked and checks the repository for the component `Example`.
If found, the component is added to the `.confix.project`.

## Available Providers

Here's a look at some available component providers and their descriptions:

| Name             | Description                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `dotnet-package` | Lets confix discover components from .NET packages |
| `git`            | Defines a git repository with confix components    |

# Appsettings

The `appsettings.json` file serves as a configuration source for .NET core projects. The
appsettings configuration file is important for developers as it allows a standard JSON
configuration while also [supporting user
secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=windows),
aiding in keeping sensitive data out of your
repository securely.

Conifx has a dedicated provider for the appsettings configuration file to provide support for user
secrets in development.

## Configuration

| Field          | Value                                                                                                                     |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| useUserSecrets | When `true` the `confix build` command will not replace the variable in the configuration file but rather use use secrets |

```json filename=".confixrc" copy
{
  "component": {},
  "project": {
    "configurationFiles": [
      {
        "type": "appsettings",
        "useUserSecrets": true
      }
    ]

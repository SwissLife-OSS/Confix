### Why Choose Confix?

1. **Simplicity at its Core**:
   Running applications locally is a breeze, but deployment often brings configuration challenges. Confix eradicates these hurdles by allowing you to store configurations in a JSON file in your Git repository. Your IDE, empowered by JSON Schemas, assists in writing accurate configurations with code completion and validation.

2. **Compose with Ease**:
   Reusing shared code across multiple locations or services in enterprise settings is now simplified. Confix enables reusability and easy composition of configuration components, saving you time and ensuring consistency across your projects.

3. **Flexibility for Every Project**:
   Every configuration file in Confix is a JSON file - easy to create and consume. Regardless of your environment, if your application can load JSON files, it can utilize Confix, making your configuration management unified and straightforward.

4. **Secure Your Secrets**:
   While Confix effortlessly manages your application configuration, it also provides a mechanism for representing secrets within your configuration using variables. The actual secret storage is your choice, whether in Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, or as environment variables, ensuring your application's security is never compromised.
